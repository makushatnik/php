Congratulations on your purchase of Breeze, one of the fastest templates ever created for Joomla! We hope this template will help make your website project a success. If you'd like to use this template on other websites too, additional licenses may be purchased at www.alledia.com/store.

This template is very easy to use, and to help you get off to a good start we've put together a few tips below:

/* Logo */
To use a logo with the template, just upload a file called logo.png to the images folder (www.your-domain.com/images). One of the easiest methods for doing this is to use Joomla's Media Manager. The logo file dimensions are 227x90 pixels.

/* Template Parameters */
The template parameters for this template contain an option to allow you to enable/disable loading of default Joomla JavaScript. Disabling the JavaScript will improve page load times, but proceed only with testing as some extensions require the JavaScript to function properly.

To access these options, log in to the administrator area of your Joomla website, and go here:
Extensions->Template Manager->Breeze.

/* Menu Setup */
Most of the menus in this template will function without any additional setup in a default Joomla installation. The single exception is the optional menu above the search box in the upper right corner of the screen. To set up this menu, open the menu module you want to use, and assign it to the "user4" position. The parameters should be as follows:
  - Menu Style: Legacy - Horizontal
  - Spacer: |

/* Module Suffixes */
Modules can be displayed using several styles. To change the style, open the module and add the appropriate module class suffix from the following list:
  - Menus: _menu
  - Colored Background (matches the main menu color): _color
  - Solid Background: _dark
  - Plain Text: _text

/* Module Positions */
 - Main Menu: user3
 - Search and User Menu: user4
 - Full-width Display Area (for Slides, Flash, etc.): slides
 - Breadcrumbs: breadcrumb
 - Newsflash (top of center column): top
 - Left column: left
 - Right column: right
 - Bottom of Page: footer
 - Footer Panel (3 columns): user1, user2, user5
 - Feed Link: syndicate
 - Copyright Information: copyright
 - Analytics Code and Debugging (located just before closing tags): debug
